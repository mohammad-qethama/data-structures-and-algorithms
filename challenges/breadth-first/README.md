# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
extend the BinaryTree class with an extra method 'breadth-first' that traverse throgh the tree using the breadth-first algorithm;

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
-`breadth-first()` push the branches of the tree in a queue left then right then take the queue front value and push it in array then dequeue it Big O Space/time (n^n)(n^n).
