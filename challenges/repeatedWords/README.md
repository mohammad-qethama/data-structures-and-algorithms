## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- `repeatedWords`  create a hash table and see if the silted string  item array is in the table as a key if not add it as a key and a value to the   hashTable.
- `HashTables`  Big O space/time O(nlogn)(nlogn)
