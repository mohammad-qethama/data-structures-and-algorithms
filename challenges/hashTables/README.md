## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
- `HashTables.get()` will find the hash index in the table and look for the value for the submitted and return value ir null Big O space/time (1)(1) .
- `HashTables`  Big O space/time O(n)(n)
