## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
-`fizzBuzzTree` use recarsive function to traverse through the tree and replace the results of testing the value in the replica tree node value used foreach also to traverse over the children nodes big .Big O space/time (1)(n).
